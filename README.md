RULES
Each player can only put stones in their own stores.
Each player can only move stones out of their own pits.
Placing the last stone in a player's own store gives that player an extra turn.
Placing the last stone in an empty pit you own where the opposing pit has stones in it, then you take the all stones from each side and place them in your own store.

Two stores in total; one for each player.
Six pits for each player's row.
